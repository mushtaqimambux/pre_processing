    "<h1>?sooo yesterday!!!</h1> i taught       the <b>students</b> about <i>nlp preprocessing</i> , yeah yeah like lower  CASE , stop words, and punctuation ... oh wow!! what a  mess mess... there were about 21 or 22 students 999 888 maybe ?? not sure 🤔 anyway  we talked and talked  and talked about commas, dots, dots... more dots..... ??? question marks, semi;colons;;; and other stuff !!!!  \n",
    "then some <div> of </div> them said like “sir why we remove punctuation 123 456 789 numbers , html tags <p></p> and spaces spaces   and more  spaces ???” i said because it makes <code>the data clean clean clean</code> oh yes YES yes.  \n",
    "we also found sooo many stopwords like \"the\" \"a\" \"an\" \"is\" \"of\" \"in\" \"to\" \"on\" \"for\" <span>and</span>  \"that\" \"by\" oh nooo, and ugh  repeated words everywhere everywhere everywhere !!!  \n",
    "sometimes  the  text  had  BIG  letters, small letters, Missing letters, ...  punctuation,  punctuation,  punctuation!!!  😩😩 lowercase is important, uppercase looks  BAD BAD BAD!!!  \n",
    "and  we  found  multiple   spaces     like     this     one     and    even     worse    ones.   some sentences ended ??? without any reason ... others ended !!!!!!! or ........ or 1234567890 randomly inserted in middle of text 😐 .  \n",
    "students were like <a href=\"#\">sir we tired</a> 😴 but i said “no!! clean the DATA!! remove html tags <img> <body> <head>, remove punctuation!!!!! remove stopwords, remove numbers 000111222333, remove emojis 😅😂🐍, remove extra spaces!!! ”  \n",
    "then one student wrote: REMOVE   STOPWORDS  PLEASE!!!!!! PLEASE  PLEASE!!!! in ALL CAPS 😭😭😭 and forgot half of the text lol lol lol.  \n",
    "we used nltk , regex , and re.sub() and .split() and join() join() join()  functions ... oh so many ( ) ( ) [ ] { } symbols; ; ; ; !!!  \n",
    "btw <html> we </html> also found that lowercase makes the <p>text</p> more readable readable readable readable readable !!! not LIKE THIS or LIKE THAT .  \n",
    "<article> after </article> finishing <section> class </section> , we all laughed, smiled, cleaned cleaned data, removed numbers(12345 67890), stopwords stopwords stopwords stopwords, and extra  spaces!!!  \n",
    "finally the dataset looked better better better better, before it was a big mess mess mess mess mess full of tags <div> <meta> <h1> </h1> <title> broken html <br> <hr> </hr> punctuation!!!  \n",
    "some text was like:  <b>this.. is.. just.. messy.. text..!!!</b>  others like  what??? why???? no idea... anyway.  \n",
    "cleaning text is so boring boring boring but also fun fun fun!!! it makes model smarter, faster, better, clearer, not slower slower slower 😜😜😜.  \n",
    "and i said again again again, “don’t forget to remove punctuation, stopwords, numbers, emojis, and html tags!!!”  \n",
    "then they all said “yes sir yes sir” three times three times three times.  \n",
    "<footer> and </footer> that’s how preprocessing works works works — lower, clean, trim, remove, filter, normalize normalize normalize normalize!!!'''"
